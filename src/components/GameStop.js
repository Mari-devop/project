            <p>Long before GameStop, there was Piggly Wiggly.\n\nIn 1923, the supermarket companyвЂ”which still does business in the South and MidwestвЂ”was at the center of a short squeeze/market morality play that echoes the recent frenzy around GameStop.\n\nAs with GameStop and other вЂњmemeвЂќ companies like AMC Entertainment, Piggly Wiggly was being sold short by several big Wall Street investment firms. This aroused an unexpected popular backlash, stirred by a resentment of вЂњcity slickersвЂќ getting rich off the вЂњyaps,вЂќ or little guys. So there was a sense of triumph when investors fought back and put the squeeze on the shorts.\n\nвЂњNew York speculators,вЂќ crowed one newspaper, вЂњmade to pay through the nose.вЂќ\n\nThe Piggly Wiggly shorts got crushed, much as Melvin Capital dropped 53% in January chiefly on its GameStop downside bets, but that wasnвЂ™t the whole story. While there were some big winners, there were also some other big losersвЂ”none bigger than Piggly WigglyвЂ™s founder and president, Clarence Saunders.\n\nвЂњAfter working a sensational squeeze on Piggly Wiggly,вЂќ BarronвЂ™s reported at the time, вЂњthe Memphis grocer found that his вЂvictoryвЂ™ had cost him about $3,000,000 and control of his company.вЂќ It also tarnished SaundersвЂ™ legacy.\n\nBorn in 1881, Saunders worked his way out of poverty to become a retail pioneer, turning Piggly Wiggly (the origins of the name remain obscure) into the nationвЂ™s first вЂњSelf-Serving StoreвЂќ in 1916.\n\nThat is, instead of giving shopping lists to clerks to fillвЂ”as was practice of the dayвЂ”customers walked the aisles and chose their own goods. This sublimely simple concept caught on; by 1921 there were more than 600 Piggly Wiggly stores across the nation, and SaundersвЂ™ self-serve model is still the norm for supermarkets, from Kroger to Walmart.\n\nTo fuel continued expansion, Saunders in November 1922 announced plans to sell 100,000 new shares in the company. That, combined with unrelated news of a Piggly Wiggly licensee filing for bankruptcy, вЂњcaused heavy sellingвЂќ in the stock, according to BarronвЂ™s, knocking the share price down to $30 from $45. Then Merrill Lynch and other Wall Street firms attempted a вЂњbear raid,вЂќ shorting Piggly Wiggly stock in a bet it would fall further.\n\nSaunders cast the issue as good versus evil, asking potential investors, вЂњShall good business flee? Shall it tremble with fear? Shall it be the loot of the speculator?вЂќ as quoted in Mike FreemanвЂ™s Clarence Saunders and the Founding of Piggly Wiggly: The Rise & Fall of a Memphis Maverick.\n\nTo counter the shorts, Saunders borrowed $10 million on margin from a number of investors and hatched a plan to buy up all outstanding shares of Piggly Wiggly, driving the price up. The stock reached $124 on March 20, 1923вЂ”when it was suspended by the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThere was a вЂњwild scramble by the shorts to cover,вЂќ BarronвЂ™s wrote, yet there was less of that than had expected. The stock showed a вЂњdeclining tendencyвЂќ after the shorts had covered, and вЂњthe over-the-counter market for the stock gradually disappeared.вЂќ In the end, вЂњSaunders and his associatesвЂќ were left with вЂњpractically the entire issue of 200,000 shares on their handsвЂ”a large part of which had been accumulated at high pricesвЂќ with вЂњno marketвЂќ to sell them.\n\nTo BarronвЂ™s, Saunders had simply suffered вЂњthe customary fate of the Main Streeter who attempts to beat Wall Street.вЂќ Indeed, just three years earlier, a short-squeeze engineered by the owner of Stutz Motor Co. ended in bankruptcy for both.\n\nYet there were winners in Piggly Wiggly, too, such as the retired grocer from Providence, R.I., that Freeman writes about, who bought a thousand shares at $38 before the squeeze. Expecting to use the shares as dividend income, the retiree instead ended up selling them вЂњfrom $96 to $124вЂќ and making a profit of almost $80,000 (around $1.2 million today).\r\n\r\nThat isnвЂ™t quite of the same magnitude as the gains made by Roaring Kitty, the GameStop investor whose initial $53,000 stake reached a value of at least $48 million. But the reality that some players will turn a handsome profit even as others are ruined hasnвЂ™t changed over the years.\r\n\r\nToday, however, instead of one big investor like Saunders being left holding all the worthless shares, there may be many thousands of smaller investors facing financial strain or collapse.\r\n\r\nAs for Saunders, he went back to Tennessee, where вЂњMemphis folk still have confidenceвЂќ in him, as BarronвЂ™s reported at the time. But his various postвЂ“Piggle Wiggly ventures, including Keedoozle automat-style stores, met with middling success. He died in 1953, his hopes of becoming the Henry Ford of supermarkets undone by an ill-fated decision to take on Wall Street.\r\n\r\nWeвЂ™ll see if GameStop investors fare any better."</p>
